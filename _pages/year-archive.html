      <p>
        This year went well! I organized *La Fiesta* for the interaction between deaf and blind children and college students, 
        tried to secure an internship but was unable to; however, company interviews boosted my confidence even if they didn't land me a job.  
        I successfully executed our capstone project, *LipSyncX*, and as the proctor of my hostel, I handled student queries and organized a memorable Diwali Night.
